This is the course Project for Mobile Game Development.

I designed and developed a game named Curling. It is inspired by one of the most popular sports in Olympic games, curling and I introduce it to iPhone so that people can play curling in iPhone now. This game requires two players to play with each other, so you can play with your friends or children. Each player can slide a ball in their own round to different area in the screen. Based on the area the ball stops, players can earn corresponding scores. The goal is quiet simple, players just need to earn as high a score as they can to defeat their rival.

In the play scene, there would be a notification to tell you which player needs to slide the ball, only after the notification appears, the player can slide a new ball.
To make a reality game, the ball would be shot to the position where players move their finger off, and the force of shot is related to the distance between the position and starting point of the ball.

Firstly, as you can see, the asset is simple and beatiful.

To defeat your rival, you can slide your balls to high score area and you also can make your ball collisde with your rival ball to make them out of the high score area.

Also, there are four kinds of effect ball in the screen, which may or may not help you get high score, you need to figure it out what would happend when your ball collides with the effect balls.
